Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. They
will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the whole
earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth."

    So God created man
    in his own image;
    he created him in the image of God;
    he created them male and female.
