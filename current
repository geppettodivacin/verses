Truly I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do.
And he will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.
Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified
in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

-- John 14:12-14 (CSB)
