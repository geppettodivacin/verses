I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to
comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth
of God’s love, and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you
may be filled with all the fullness of God.

-- Ephesians 3:17b-19 CSB
